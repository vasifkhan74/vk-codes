This the home page</h1>

<p> home page is the main web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine,<br>
 and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory,<br>
 particularly when a website has multiple home pages.<br>

Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;<br>
 for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories,<br>
 with links to full articles.[5][6] According to Homepage Usability,<br>
 the home page is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.<br>
 A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.<br>
One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.<br>
