Want to know the real deal about HTML and CSS? HTML and CSS are scripting languages used to create a web page and web applications.<
br>
 HTML provides web page structure, whereas CSS is mainly used to control web page styling.<br>
 This article will discuss the significant differences between HTML and CSS.

<summary>HTML</summary>
<p>HyperText: HyperText or “text wrapped within a text.” is very similar to a hyperlink, but contains an underlying text which,<br>
 when clicked, initiates a redirection to a new webpage.
Markup language: A markup language needn’t be a programming language,<br>
 but helps in applying formatting and layout to a text document. <br>
 It helps create a more dynamic and interactive text content.

 of making web pages presentable.CSS is designed to enable the separation of document content from document<br>
 presentation, including elements such as font, layout, and colors.<br>
The style definitions are usually saved in external .css files.</p>
